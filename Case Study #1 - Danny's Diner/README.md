## üí° My Solution

### Q1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

```SQL
SELECT 
    customer_id, -- Select customer ID
    SUM(price) AS total_amount_spent -- Calculate total amount spent by each customer
FROM 
    dannys_diner.sales -- Use sales table to get customer transactions
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu USING(product_id) -- Join with menu table using product ID to get prices
GROUP BY 
    customer_id -- Group results by customer ID to aggregate spending
ORDER BY 
    customer_id; -- Sort results by customer ID for organized presentation
```

| customer_id | total_amount_spent |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| A           | 76                 |
| B           | 74                 |

### Q10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

```SQL
SELECT 
    customer_id, -- Select customer ID
    SUM(
        CASE 
            WHEN customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM dannys_diner.members) AND product_name = 'sushi' THEN 20 * price -- Calculate points with 2x multiplier for sushi purchases by members

            WHEN customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM dannys_diner.members) THEN 10 * price -- Calculate points with normal multiplier for subsequent purchases by members
            ELSE 0 -- Non-member purchases earn 0 points
        END

    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu USING (product_id) -- Join with menu table using product ID
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.members USING (customer_id) -- Join with members table using customer ID
WHERE 
    order_date BETWEEN join_date AND '2021-01-31' -- Filter transactions within the first week after joining and January 2021
GROUP BY 
    customer_id -- Group results by customer ID
ORDER BY 
    customer_id; -- Sort results by customer ID
```
| customer_id | points_earned |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| A           | 1020          |
| B           | 320           |

### Join All The Things - Create a table that has these columns: customer_id, order_date, product_name, price, member (Y/N).
