#### Insights

##### Quantifiable Impact of Sustainable Packaging (June 2020):

- Sales Consistency: Annual sales figures exhibit stability, with negligible variation across years.
- Seasonal Trends: Sales from April to August consistently surpass those from March and September across all regions.
- Platform Distribution: A dominant 97% of sales are processed through the retail platform, whereas Shopify accounts for the remaining 3%. However, the average transaction value on Shopify is quintuple that of retail transactions.
- Demographic Contribution: Couples contribute 28% to total sales, families 32%, and the unknown demographic group 40%. Retiree families lead sales within known segments.
- Geographical Reception: The sustainable packaging initiative has been positively received in Europe. Conversely, regions such as Asia, Oceania, and South Africa exhibit significant reluctance.
- Platform-Specific Impact: Sustainable packaging introduction has resulted in increased sales on Shopify but a decrease on the retail platform.
- Age Group Response: While sales have generally declined post-change, young adults show the least impact, with middle-aged, retirees, and unknown age groups showing higher adverse effects.
- Demographic Group Impact: Couples demonstrate the least sales reduction, whereas families and unknown demographics are more negatively affected.
- Customer Type Response: New customers exhibit a preference for sustainable packaging, unlike existing customers and guests who show a negative response.

#### Recommendations

##### Customer Registration and Data Enhancement:

- Loyalty Programs: Implement loyalty programs to incentivize customer registration on both Retail and Shopify platforms. This initiative aims to reduce the unknown values in demographic and age data, facilitating more granular insights.

##### Strategic Focus Areas:

1. Regional Packaging Strategy:

    - Europe: Maintain sustainable packaging for all products.
    - Other Regions: Apply sustainable packaging selectively to products preferred by Couples and Young Adults, as these segments are less averse to the change.

2. Platform-Specific Strategy:

    - Shopify: Continue using sustainable packaging for all products sold on Shopify, leveraging the higher transaction value and positive reception.

3. Decision-Making Framework:

    - Customer Type Neutrality: Avoid basing strategic packaging decisions on customer type (new, existing, guest), due to the complexity in predicting preferences accurately. Instead, focus on demographic and age-based preferences.

##### Additional Recommendations:

- Marketing and Education: Develop targeted marketing campaigns to educate and promote the benefits of sustainable packaging, especially in regions and demographics showing resistance.
- Feedback Mechanisms: Establish robust feedback loops with customers to continually assess and address their concerns regarding sustainable packaging.
- Product Diversification: Consider diversifying product offerings with both sustainable and traditional packaging options, to cater to varied customer preferences while gradually encouraging sustainable choices.

#### Conclusion:

The implementation of sustainable packaging has had varied impacts across different platforms, regions, demographics, and customer types. By strategically focusing on areas of strength and leveraging loyalty programs, Data Mart can mitigate negative impacts and continue its commitment to sustainability without compromising sales performance. Further, ongoing analysis and customer engagement will be crucial in fine-tuning these strategies to optimize outcomes.
