## üí° My Solution

### Q1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

```SQL

        FROM 
            data_mart.clean_weekly_sales 
        WHERE 
            week_date = TO_DATE('2020-06-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD') -- Filter for the specific baseline date
    ),
    comparison_cte AS (
        SELECT 
            SUM(
                CASE

### Q2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

### Q3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

```SQL
