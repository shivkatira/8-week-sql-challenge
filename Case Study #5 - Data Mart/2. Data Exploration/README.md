## üí° My Solution

### Q1. What day of the week is used for each `week_date` value?

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT 
    TO_CHAR(week_date, 'DAY') AS week_day -- Convert week_date to the name of the day of the week
FROM 
    data_mart.clean_weekly_sales; -- Select from the clean_weekly_sales table in the data_mart schema
```

| week_day  |
| --------- |
| MONDAY    |

### Q2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?

```SQL
WITH all_week_number_cte AS (
    SELECT 
        GENERATE_SERIES(1, 53)::TEXT AS all_week_number -- Generate a series of week numbers from 1 to 53
)
SELECT 
    all_week_number -- Select all generated week numbers
FROM 
    all_week_number_cte -- From the generated series of week numbers
WHERE 
    all_week_number NOT IN ( 
        SELECT 
            week_number -- Select week numbers present in the dataset
        FROM 
            data_mart.clean_weekly_sales -- From the clean_weekly_sales table in the data_mart schema
    );
```

### Q3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?

```SQL
SELECT 
    calendar_year, -- Select the calendar year
    SUM(transactions) AS total_transactions -- Calculate the total number of transactions for each year

### Q9. Can we use the `avg_transaction` column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

```SQL
WITH 
    -- Calculate annual sales for each calendar year
    annual_sales_cte AS (
        SELECT 
            calendar_year, 
            SUM(sales) AS annual_sales -- Sum of sales for each calendar year
        FROM 
            data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
        GROUP BY 
            calendar_year
        ORDER BY 
            calendar_year
    )
    
-- Query to compare average transaction sizes between Retail and Shopify
SELECT 
    calendar_year, -- Select calendar year
    platform, -- Select platform (Retail or Shopify)
    ROUND( AVG(avg_transaction), 2 ) AS avg_transaction_aggregated, -- Calculate aggregated average transaction size
    ROUND( SUM(sales)/ SUM(transactions), 2 ) AS avg_transaction_calculated -- Calculate average transaction size directly
FROM 
    data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY 
    calendar_year, platform -- Group by calendar year and platform
ORDER BY 
    calendar_year, platform; -- Sort results by calendar year and platform
```

| calendar_year | platform | avg_transaction_aggregated | avg_transaction_calculated |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 2018          | Retail   | 42.41                      | 36.00                      |
| 2018          | Shopify  | 187.80                     | 192.00                     |
| 2019          | Retail   | 41.47                      | 36.00                      |
| 2019          | Shopify  | 177.07                     | 183.00                     |
| 2020          | Retail   | 40.14                      | 36.00                      |
| 2020          | Shopify  | 174.40                     | 179.00                     |
