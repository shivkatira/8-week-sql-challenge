* [In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named clean_weekly_sales:](#in-a-single-query-perform-the-following-operations-and-generate-a-new-table-in-the-data_mart-schema-named-clean_weekly_sales)
    - Convert the `week_date` to a DATE format
    - Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
    - Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
    - Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
    - Add a new column called `age_band` after the original `segment` column using the following mapping on the number inside the `segment` value
        | segment | age_band     |
        |---------|--------------|
        | 1       | Young Adults |
        | 2	      | Middle Aged  |
        | 3 or 4  | Retirees     |

    - Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment` values:
        | segment | demographic  |
        |---------|--------------|
        | C       | Couples      |
        | F	      | Families     |
    - Ensure all `null` string values with an "unknown" string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
    - Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

## üí° My Solution

### In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named clean_weekly_sales:
- Convert the `week_date` to a DATE format
- Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
- Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called `age_band` after the original `segment` column using the following mapping on the number inside the `segment` value
    | segment | age_band     |
    |---------|--------------|
    | 1       | Young Adults |
    | 2	      | Middle Aged  |
    | 3 or 4  | Retirees     |

- Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment` values:
    | segment | demographic  |
    |---------|--------------|
    | C       | Couples      |
    | F	      | Families     |
- Ensure all `null` string values with an "unknown" string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
- Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

**Attention:**
- Because presenting the entire output is impractical, the above table only displays the first 10 rows.
