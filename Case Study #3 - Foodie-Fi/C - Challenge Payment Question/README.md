## üí° My Solution

### The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

**Attention:**
 - Because presenting the entire output is impractical, the above table only displays the sample rows.
 - To make table `payment` reusable for the [D. Outside The Box Questions](../D%20-%20Outside%20The%20Box%20Questions/README.md), the expression `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM payment_date) = '2020'` is used when querying the table rather than when constructing it.
