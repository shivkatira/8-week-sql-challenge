## üí° My Solution

### Q1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

```SQL
WITH revenue_cte AS (
    SELECT 
        TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS period, -- Format payment date to year-month period
        TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'MONTH-YYYY') AS month, -- Format payment date to month-year
        SUM(amount) AS revenue -- Calculate total revenue for each period
    FROM 
        foodie_fi.payment -- Use payment table
    WHERE 
        payment_date <= (SELECT MAX(start_date) FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions) -- Filter for payments till the last date of transactions
    GROUP BY 
        period, month -- Group by formatted period and month
    ORDER BY 
        period -- Order by period
) 
SELECT 
    period, -- Select period (year-month)
    month, -- Select month (month-year)
    revenue, -- Select calculated revenue
    ROUND(
        COALESCE(
            revenue * 100.0 / LAG(revenue, 1) OVER(ORDER BY period ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING), 
            200
        ) - 100, 
        2
    ) AS growth_rate -- Calculate growth rate as percentage change from previous period
FROM 
    revenue_cte -- Use revenue_cte for data
ORDER BY 
    period; -- Order results by period
```

 - Because presenting the entire output is impractical, the above table only displays the sample rows.
 - The above table gives an overall view of each customer in a compact manner. We can use the same CTE to go further into the customer's journey.

## Q5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?

**Analysis of Customer Behavior:**

In the analysis of customer behavior, it was observed that no customers downgraded their plans and approximately half of the customers retained a single plan after the trial period. These insights, combined with data from the exit survey, provide a comprehensive understanding of customer experiences with the platform‚Äôs interface, content quality, perceived value for money, re-subscription barriers, digital content consumption patterns, and competitive landscape.

**Strategic Interventions:**

Based on these insights, the following strategic interventions can be implemented:

1. Enhancement of Platform Interface:

    - Action: Address gaps in customer expectations regarding the platform interface by benchmarking against competitors and implementing UI/UX improvements.
    - Rationale: An enhanced user interface can increase user satisfaction and reduce churn.

2. Content Quality Improvement:

    - Action: If content quality is identified as an issue, introduce offers to upgrade plans or expand the content library.
    - Rationale: High-quality, diverse content can improve user engagement and retention.

3. Perceived Value Adjustment:

    - Action: For customers perceiving the service as not providing value for money, offer the option to downgrade rather than cancel subscriptions, or introduce targeted promotions.
    - Rationale: Offering flexible pricing options can retain customers who might otherwise leave.

4. Re-engagement Offers:

    - Action: Provide special offers to former subscribers to incentivize them to rejoin the platform.
    - Rationale: Re-engagement strategies can bring back previous customers, reducing overall churn.

5. Validation of Effectiveness:

    - The effectiveness of these strategies can be validated through data analysis using SQL queries, as outlined in the solution to [question 3](#q3-what-are-some-key-customer-journeys-or-experiences-that-you-would-analyse-further-to-improve-customer-retention).

By systematically implementing and evaluating these strategies, Foodie-Fi can effectively reduce customer churn and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
