## üí° My Solution

### Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customer‚Äôs onboarding journey.

```SQL
SELECT 
    customer_id, -- Identify the customer
    plan_name, -- Name of the subscription plan
    start_date, -- Start date of the subscription
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS customer_journey_stage -- Rank the subscription stages for each customer
FROM 
    foodie_fi.subscriptions -- Access the subscriptions table
LEFT JOIN 
    foodie_fi.plans USING (plan_id) -- Join with plans table to get plan details
ORDER BY 
    customer_id, plan_id, start_date, customer_journey_stage; -- Order results for clarity
```
