## üí° My Solution

### Q1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

```SQL
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        pizza_name, -- Name of the pizza
        UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(toppings, ','))::NUMERIC AS topping_id -- Extract topping IDs from the toppings list
    FROM 
        pizza_runner.pizza_recipes -- Access the table containing pizza recipes
    LEFT JOIN 
        pizza_runner.pizza_names USING (pizza_id) -- Join with pizza names table using pizza ID
)
-- Select the pizza name and the aggregated list of distinct toppings for each pizza
SELECT 
    pizza_name, -- Name of the pizza
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT topping_name, ',') AS toppings -- Aggregate the distinct topping names into a comma-separated list
FROM 
    cte -- Use the common table expression (CTE) containing pizza data
LEFT JOIN 
    pizza_runner.pizza_toppings USING (topping_id) -- Join with pizza toppings table using topping ID
GROUP BY 
    pizza_name -- Group the results by pizza name
ORDER BY 
    pizza_name; -- Sort the results by pizza name
```

| pizza_name | toppings                                                       |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meatlovers | BBQ Sauce,Bacon,Beef,Cheese,Chicken,Mushrooms,Pepperoni,Salami |
| Vegetarian | Cheese,Mushrooms,Onions,Peppers,Tomato Sauce,Tomatoes          |

### Q2. What was the most commonly added extra?

```SQL
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(extras, ','))::NUMERIC AS topping_id -- Extract topping IDs from the extras list
    FROM 
        pizza_runner.customer_orders -- Access the table containing customer orders
    WHERE 
        extras IS NOT NULL -- Filter out orders without extras
)
-- Select the topping name and count of occurrences for each extra
SELECT 
    topping_name, -- Name of the extra topping
    COUNT(topping_id) AS count_extra -- Count of occurrences for each extra topping
FROM 
    cte -- Use the common table expression (CTE) containing extra toppings data
LEFT JOIN 
    pizza_runner.pizza_toppings USING (topping_id) -- Join with pizza toppings table using topping ID
GROUP BY 
    topping_name -- Group the results by topping name
ORDER BY 
    count_extra DESC -- Sort the results by count of occurrences in descending order
LIMIT 1; -- Limit the result to the most commonly added extra
```

| topping_name | count_extra |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Bacon        | 4           |

### Q3. What was the most common exclusion?

```SQL
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(exclusions, ','))::NUMERIC AS topping_id -- Extract topping IDs from the exclusions list
    FROM 
        pizza_runner.customer_orders -- Access the table containing customer orders
    WHERE 
        exclusions IS NOT NULL -- Filter out orders without exclusions
)
-- Select the topping name and count of occurrences for each exclusion
SELECT 
    topping_name, -- Name of the excluded topping
    COUNT(topping_id) AS count_exclusion -- Count of occurrences for each exclusion topping
FROM 
    cte -- Use the common table expression (CTE) containing exclusion toppings data
LEFT JOIN 
    pizza_runner.pizza_toppings USING (topping_id) -- Join with pizza toppings table using topping ID
GROUP BY 
    topping_name -- Group the results by topping name
ORDER BY 
    count_exclusion DESC -- Sort the results by count of occurrences in descending order
LIMIT 1; -- Limit the result to the most common exclusion
```
| topping_name | count_exclusion |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Cheese       | 4               |

### Q4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
- Meat Lovers
- Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
- Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
- Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers

```SQL
