## üí° My Solution

### Q1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

```SQL
SELECT 
    SUM(
        CASE 
            WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 12 -- Calculate total earnings for Meat Lovers pizza
            ELSE 10 -- Calculate total earnings for Vegetarian pizza
        END
    ) AS earnings -- Sum the total earnings
FROM 
    pizza_runner.customer_orders -- Access the customer_orders table to get order information
    LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders USING(order_id) -- Join with the runner_orders table using order_id
WHERE 
    distance IS NOT NULL; -- Filter out null distances to ensure only successful deliveries are considered
```

| earnings |
| -------- |
| 138      |

### Q2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
- Add cheese is $1 extra

```SQL
SELECT 
    SUM( -- Calculate total earnings
        CASE 
            WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 12 -- If the pizza is Meat Lovers, price is $12
            ELSE 10 -- If the pizza is Vegetarian, price is $10
        END 
        + COALESCE( array_length(STRING_TO_ARRAY(extras, ','), 1)::NUMERIC, 0) -- Add $1 for each extra (e.g., cheese)
    ) AS total_earnings -- Alias for the total earnings
FROM 
    pizza_runner.customer_orders -- Access customer orders table
    LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders USING(order_id) -- Join with runner orders using order ID
WHERE 
    distance IS NOT NULL; -- Filter out orders with null distance
```

| total_earnings |
| -------------- |
| 142            |

### Q3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

```SQL
-- Drop the table if it already exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pizza_runner.customer_ratings;

-- Create the new table for customer ratings
CREATE TABLE pizza_runner.customer_ratings (
    order_id INTEGER, -- Order ID for the customer order
    ratings INTEGER -- Rating given by the customer (between 1 to 5)
);

-- Insert sample data for ratings for each successful customer order
INSERT INTO pizza_runner.customer_ratings (order_id, ratings) 
VALUES 
    (1, 5), 
    (2, 1), 
    (3, 5), 
    (4, 2), 
    (5, 3), 
    (7, 4), 
    (8, 2), 
    (10, 5);

-- Retrieve and display the data from the customer_ratings table
SELECT * FROM pizza_runner.customer_ratings;
```

### Q4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
- customer_id
- order_id
- runner_id
- rating
- order_time
- pickup_time
- Time between order and pickup
- Delivery duration
- Average speed
- Total number of pizzas

```SQL
SELECT 
    customer_id, -- Customer ID
    order_id, -- Order ID
    runner_id, -- Runner ID
    ratings, -- Rating
    order_time, -- Order time
    TO_TIMESTAMP(pickup_time, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') AS pickup_time, -- Pickup time
    EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM AGE(TO_TIMESTAMP(pickup_time, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), order_time)) AS time_between_order_to_pickup, -- Time between order and pickup
    duration, -- Delivery duration
    ROUND(AVG(distance::NUMERIC /(duration::NUMERIC / 60)), 2) AS average_speed, -- Average speed
    COUNT(pizza_id) AS total_number_of_pizzas -- Total number of pizzas
FROM 
    pizza_runner.runner_orders
LEFT JOIN 
    pizza_runner.customer_orders USING (order_id)
LEFT JOIN 
    pizza_runner.customer_ratings USING (order_id)
WHERE 
    distance IS NOT NULL -- Consider only successful deliveries
GROUP BY 
    customer_id, order_id, runner_id, ratings, order_time, pickup_time, duration
ORDER BY 
    customer_id, order_id, runner_id, ratings, order_time, pickup_time, duration;
```

| customer_id | order_id | runner_id | ratings | order_time               | pickup_time              | time_between_order_to_pickup | duration | average_speed | total_number_of_pizzas |

### Q5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

```SQL
WITH order_costs AS (
    SELECT 
        order_id, 
        SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 12 ELSE 10 END) AS pizza_cost, -- Calculate total pizza cost based on type
        AVG(distance::NUMERIC * 0.3) AS runner_fee -- Calculate runner fees based on distance
    FROM 
        pizza_runner.customer_orders 
    LEFT JOIN 
        pizza_runner.runner_orders USING (order_id) 
    WHERE 
        distance IS NOT NULL -- Consider only successful deliveries
    GROUP BY 
        order_id
)
SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(pizza_cost - runner_fee), 2) AS net_earnings -- Calculate net earnings
FROM 
    order_costs;
```

| net_earnings |
| ------------ |
| 94.44        |
