## üí° My Solution

### If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?

```SQL
-- To expand the range of pizzas, we would need to update the pizza_names table with the new pizza name 
-- and the pizza_recipes table with the toppings for the new pizza.

-- Inserting a new pizza named "Supreme" into the pizza_names table
INSERT INTO pizza_runner.pizza_names("pizza_id", "pizza_name") 
VALUES (3, 'Supreme');

-- Verifying the addition of the new pizza in the pizza_names table
SELECT * FROM pizza_runner.pizza_names;

-- Adding the toppings for the new "Supreme" pizza into the pizza_recipes table
INSERT INTO pizza_runner.pizza_recipes ("pizza_id", "toppings") 
VALUES (3, '1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12');

-- Verifying the addition of toppings for the new pizza in the pizza_recipes table
SELECT * FROM pizza_runner.pizza_recipes;
```
