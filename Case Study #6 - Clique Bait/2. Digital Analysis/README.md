## üí° My Solution

### Q1. How many users are there?

```SQL
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS user_count -- Count the distinct number of users
FROM 
    clique_bait.users; -- Use the users table to find the count of distinct user IDs
```

| user_count |
| ---------- |
| 500        |

### Q2. How many cookies does each user have on average?

```SQL
WITH cookie_count_cte AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id, -- Select user ID
        COUNT(DISTINCT cookie_id) AS cookie_count -- Count distinct cookies per user
    FROM 
        clique_bait.users -- Use the users table to get user and cookie data
    GROUP BY 
        user_id -- Group by user ID to count cookies per user
)
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(cookie_count), 3) AS average_cookie_count -- Calculate the average number of cookies per user and round to 3 decimal places
FROM 
    cookie_count_cte; -- Use the CTE to get the average cookie count
```

| average_cookie_count |
| -------------------- |

    COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) AS distinct_visits -- Count distinct visits per month
FROM 
    clique_bait.events -- Use the events table to get visit data
