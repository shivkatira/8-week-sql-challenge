## üí° My Solution

### Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:
- user_id
- visit_id
- visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit
- page_views: count of page views for each visit
- cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit
- purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
- campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
- impression: count of ad impressions for each visit
- click: count of ad clicks for each visit
- (Optional column) cart_products: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)

### What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who just an impression but do not click?

### What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to eachother?

```SQL
SELECT 
    campaign_name, -- Select campaign name
    ROUND(SUM(click) * 100.0 / SUM(impression), 2) AS impression_click_rate, -- Calculate impression to click rate
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN click > 0 THEN cart_adds ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / SUM(CASE WHEN click > 0 THEN page_views ELSE 0 END), 2) AS cart_add_rate, -- Calculate cart add rate for users who clicked
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN click > 0 THEN purchase ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / SUM(CASE WHEN click > 0 THEN cart_adds ELSE 0 END), 2) AS cart_add_to_purchase_rate, -- Calculate cart add to purchase rate for users who clicked
    100 - ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN click > 0 THEN purchase ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / SUM(CASE WHEN click > 0 THEN cart_adds ELSE 0 END), 2) AS cart_abandonment_rate -- Calculate cart abandonment rate for users who clicked
FROM 
    clique_bait.campaign_analysis -- Use campaign_analysis table
WHERE 
    campaign_name IS NOT NULL -- Ensure campaign name is not null
GROUP BY 
    campaign_name -- Group by campaign name
ORDER BY 
    campaign_name; -- Order by campaign name
```
