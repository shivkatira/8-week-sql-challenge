## üí° My Solution

### Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:
- How many times was each product viewed?
- How many times was each product added to cart?
- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
- How many times was each product purchased?

| product_category | page_name      | page_views_count | add_to_cart_count | cart_abandonment_count | purchase_count |

### Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

```SQL

        SUM(cart_abandonment_count) AS total_cart_abandonment, -- Sum of cart abandonment counts for each product category
        SUM(purchase_count) AS total_purchases -- Sum of purchase counts for each product category
    FROM 
        clique_bait.product_funnel -- Use the product funnel table for source data
    GROUP BY 
        product_category -- Group results by product category
    ORDER BY 
        product_category -- Order results by product category
);

SELECT * FROM clique_bait.product_category_funnel; -- Select all records from the newly created product category funnel table
```

```

| product_category | page_name | purchase_count |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------- |

| ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Luxury           | Russian Caviar | 249                    |

### Q3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?

```SQL

### Q4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?

```SQL
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(add_to_cart_count * 100.0 / page_views_count), 2) AS average_view_to_cart_add_rate -- Calculate the average conversion rate from view to cart add, rounded to two decimal places
FROM 
    clique_bait.product_funnel; -- Use the product_funnel table to get the necessary counts
```

| average_view_to_cart_add_rate |
| ----------------------------- |
| 60.95                         |

### Q5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?

```SQL
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(purchase_count * 100.0 / add_to_cart_count), 2) AS average_cart_to_purchase_rate -- Calculate the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase, rounded to two decimal places

    clique_bait.product_funnel; -- Use the product_funnel table to get the necessary counts
```

| average_cart_to_purchase_rate |
| ----------------------------- |
| 75.93                         |
