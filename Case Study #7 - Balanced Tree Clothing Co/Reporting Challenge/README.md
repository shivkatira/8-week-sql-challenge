## üí° My Solution

### Write a single SQL script that combines all of the previous questions into a scheduled report that the Balanced Tree team can run at the beginning of each month to calculate the previous month‚Äôs values.

```SQL
-- Drop the table if it exists and create a new one for the month under analysis
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS month_under_analysis;
CREATE TABLE month_under_analysis (month_value INT, year_value INT);
INSERT INTO month_under_analysis (month_value, year_value) VALUES (1, 2021);
```

**Attention:**
  - Replace `1` and `2021` with the desired `month_value` and `year_value` to produce the insights shown below for that particular month.
